    "and never mentioning `cube` explicitly. This would place us at a serious disadvantage, forcing us to work always at the level of the particular operations that happen to be primitives in the language (multiplication, in this case) rather than in terms of higher-level operations. Our programs would be able to compute cubes, but our language would lack the ability to express the concept of cubing. One of the things we should demand from a powerful programming language is the ability to build abstractions by assigning names to common patterns and then to work in terms of the abstractions directly. Procedures provide this ability. This is why all but the most primitive programming languages include mechanisms for defining procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet even in numerical processing we will be severely limited in our ability to create abstractions if we are restricted to procedures whose parameters must be numbers. Often the same programming pattern will be used with a number of different procedures. To express such patterns as concepts, we will need to construct procedures that can accept procedures as arguments or return procedures as values. Procedures that manipulate procedures are called *higher-order procedures*. This section shows how higher-order procedures can serve as powerful abstraction mechanisms, vastly increasing the expressive power of our language.\n",

With higher-order procedures, such as the `integral` procedure of [1.3.1](#g_t1_002e3_002e1), we began to see a more powerful kind of abstraction: procedures used to express general methods of computation, independent of the particular functions involved.

    "\n",
    "The *half-interval method* is a simple but powerful technique for finding roots of an equation $f(x) = 0$, where $f$ is a continuous function. The idea is that, if we are given points $a$ and $b$ such that $f(a) < 0 < f(b)$, then $f$ must have at least one zero between $a$ and $b$. To locate a zero, let $x$ be the average of $a$ and $b$, and compute $f(x)$. If $f(x) > 0$, then $f$ must have a zero between $a$ and $x$. If $f(x) < 0$, then $f$ must have a zero between $x$ and $b$. Continuing in this way, we can identify smaller and smaller intervals on which $f$ must have a zero. When we reach a point where the interval is small enough, the process stops. Since the interval of uncertainty is reduced by half at each step of the process, the number of steps required grows as $\\Theta(\\log(L\\,/\\, T))$, where $L$ is the length of the original interval and $T$ is the error tolerance (that is, the size of the interval we will consider “small enough”).

    "**Exercise 1.44:** The idea of *smoothing* a function is an important concept in signal processing. If $f$ is a function and $dx$ is some small number, then the smoothed version of $f$ is the function whose value at a point $x$ is the average of $f(x - dx)$, $f(x)$, and $f(x + dx)$. Write a procedure `smooth` that takes as input a procedure that computes $f$ and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed $f$. It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtain the **n*-fold smoothed function*. Show how to generate the *n*-fold smoothed function of any given function using `smooth` and `repeated` from [Exercise 1.43](#Exercise-1_002e43).\n",

The same method works for finding cube roots as fixed points of the average-damped $y\\mapsto x/y^{2}$. Unfortunately, the process does not work for fourth roots—a single average damp is not enough to make a fixed-point search for $y\\mapsto x/y^{3}$ converge. On the other hand, if we average damp twice (i.e., use the average damp of the average damp of $y\\mapsto x/y^{3}$) the fixed-point search does converge. Do some experiments to determine how many average damps are required to compute $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots as a fixed-point search based upon repeated average damping of $y\\mapsto x/y^{\\mspace{2mu} n - 1}$. Use this to implement a simple procedure for computing $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots using `fixed-point`, `average-damp`, and the `repeated` procedure of [Exercise 1.43](#Exercise-1_002e43). Assume that any arithmetic operations you need are available as primitives.\n",

    "**Exercise 1.46:** Several of the numerical methods described in this chapter are instances of an extremely general computational strategy known as *iterative improvement*. Iterative improvement says that, to compute something, we start with an initial guess for the answer, test if the guess is good enough, and otherwise improve the guess and continue the process using the improved guess as the new guess. Write a procedure `iterative-improve` that takes two procedures as arguments: a method for telling whether a guess is good enough and a method for improving a guess. `Iterative-improve` should return as its value a procedure that takes a guess as argument and keeps improving the guess until it is good enough. Rewrite the `sqrt` procedure of [1.1.7](1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e7) and the `fixed-point` procedure of [1.3.3](#g_t1_002e3_002e3) in terms of `iterative-improve`."
